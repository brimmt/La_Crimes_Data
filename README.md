This repository showcases a database project where I practiced coding in Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze, visualize, and gain insights from data. The dataset, sourced from LA Crime Data (2020 to Present), was used to explore various data analysis techniques, including data cleaning and visualization.

Key Features:
Data Import: Imported the dataset into Jupyter Notebook for easy manipulation and analysis using Pandas.
Data Visualization: Used Matplotlib to create meaningful visualizations, helping to better understand patterns in crime data.
Data Analysis: Applied Pandas for various data processing tasks such as cleaning, filtering, and summarizing data.

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook
